.mlxtran files are Monolix files
.txt files with the same name are ODE model code files

File names correspond to whether lambda (CD4+ T Cell production rate from the thymys), 
Tmax (pseudomaximum value of the CD4+ T cell count), and c (viral clearance) are time 
varying, 

So 101 has lambda and c as time varying parameters.

File c2c3 contains all adult data including additional infant data.
